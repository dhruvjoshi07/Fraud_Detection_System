🛡️ Fraud Detection and Risk Management System
📌 Overview

Supports real-time streaming (simulated) using batch processing

The Fraud Detection and Risk Management System is designed to identify, prevent, and manage fraudulent activities in real-time transactions.
It analyzes user behavior, transaction patterns, and risk factors to detect suspicious activities and reduce financial losses.

This system is useful for banks, payment gateways, e-commerce platforms, and financial institutions.

🎯 Objectives

Detect fraudulent transactions in real-time

Minimize financial risk and losses

Assign risk scores to users and transactions

Block or flag suspicious activities...

Improve security and trust in digital transactions

🚀 Features

🔍 Real-time Fraud Detection

📊 Risk Scoring System

🤖 Rule-based + ML-based detection

🚫 Transaction Blocking & Alerts

🧾 Audit Logs & Reports

🔐 User & Admin Role Management

🏗️ System Architecture

Flow of the system:

User initiates a transaction

Transaction data is captured

Fraud detection engine analyzes the data

Risk score is calculated

Decision is taken:

Approve transaction

Flag as suspicious

Block transaction

Admin dashboard shows alerts and reports

Real-Time / Streaming 
Supports near real-time fraud detection using batch + streaming simulation
Designed to integrate with Kafka / streaming pipelines (future scope)

🧠 How Fraud Detection Works
1️⃣ Data Collection

The system collects:

User ID

Transaction amount

Location

IP address

Device information

Time and frequency of transactions

2️⃣ Fraud Detection Techniques
✅ Rule-Based Detection

Predefined rules such as:

Transaction amount > daily limit

Multiple transactions in a short time

Login from unusual location

Multiple failed attempts

Example:

IF transaction_amount > 100000 AND new_location = TRUE
THEN mark as suspicious

✅ Machine Learning-Based Detection (Optional/Advanced)

Uses historical transaction data

Detects hidden patterns

Learns new fraud behaviors over time

Common algorithms:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Isolation Forest

3️⃣ Risk Scoring

Each transaction is assigned a risk score (0–100):

0–30 → Low Risk

31–70 → Medium Risk

71–100 → High Risk

Decision depends on risk score.

4️⃣ Decision Engine
Risk Level	Action
Low Risk	Transaction Approved
Medium Risk	OTP / Manual Verification
High Risk	Transaction Blocked
